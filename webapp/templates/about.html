                Nutrition and overall access to food is a critical component to well-being and the overall health of an individual. Unfortunately, many regions around the world lack access and/or the ability to consume fresh and quality foods. As a result, many Americans find it hard to check off essential components of a healthy diet. Food deserts are defined as areas across the United States, often low-income, where there is limited access to nutritious and affordable food, especially fruits vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat milk. More specifically, food deserts are census tracts where more than 500 people or over 33 percent of the population in that tract must travel over a mile for fresh groceries.<br/>
                <br/>
                Over 23.5 million people reside in food deserts, and while there have been efforts to implement grocery stores in some areas to see how eating habits and overall health changes, it is sometimes too late to change pre-existing habits. The areas with relatively few grocery stores will also likely be areas that tend to be under-resourced and disadvantaged in other ways. Additionally, grocery stores are less likely to build in lower income neighborhoods and often veer away from areas where other businesses have not built due to concern of success.<br/>
                <br/>
                Food desert data is only being released every 5 years (so far 2010 and 2015), but preventative action could be taken to reverse at-risk regions if we could catch these census tracts early on. looking at the map of current food deserts below, we can see how many tracts are suffering from food deserts and how many areas could benefit from reversing these deserts.

                I am predicting food deserts using population health and twitter sentiment to provide more up-to-date predicitons of at-risk census tracts. I utilize factors/features that are not currently being used by the United States Department of Agriculture
                Economic Research Service (USDA ERA) to predict food deserts in hopes that other census data can help us flag the same food desert regions. This analysis allows us to uncover what population health factors are correlated with food deserts and just how big of an impact these conditions have on health of individuals.

                Calculating the sentiment in social media is a great way to find out how residents feel about different types of foods and restaurants. Twitter is a social media platform where people are able to express opinions quickly, concisely, and at scale. Collecting and calculating the sentiment of tweets allows me to grasp information that is being provided by people in census tracts across the US. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Combining population health and social media sentiment, I aim to map how different opinions and statistics about health map to the areas of food deserts.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My model would help to inform the public of at-risk areas where there is room for growth. Action could be taken to reverse risk of food deserts through possible grocery store implementation plans or fresh food initiatives. These grocery stores could also benefit from this predictive modeling when deciding on areas to consider building. Opening in areas with fewer grocery stores present could result in additional profit given the low competition while also benefiting the census tract by providing access to nutritional meals.

                I utilized health behavioral data from the Population Health Division of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This dataset contains statistics regarding overall health for census tracts across the United States.

                I additionally pulled social media twitter data through the Twitter API to analyze patterns of healthy vs. unhealthy consumption. To accomplish this filtered search, I created lists for the following 4 topics and pulled any mention of any of the words in these lists over a span of 1.5 weeks:

                After pulling data from twitter, the prevalence of each of the words/phrases is proportional to the size of the word in the clusters above. Each of these datasets were pulled into MongoDB, and stored for pre-processing.

                The target data, a classification of whether each census tract is currently classified as a food desert or not, came from US Department of Agriculture (USDA) dataset.
