            Nutrition and overall access to food is a critical component to well-being and the overall health of an individual. Unfortunately, many regions around the world lack access and/or the ability to consume fresh and quality foods. As a result, many Americans find it hard to check off essential components of a healthy diet. Food deserts are defined as areas across the United States, often low-income, where there is limited access to nutritious and affordable food, especially fruits vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat milk. More specifically, food deserts are census tracts where more than 500 people or over 33 percent of the population in that tract must travel over a mile for fresh groceries.<br/>
            <br/>
            Over 23.5 million people reside in food deserts, and while there have been efforts to implement grocery stores in some areas to see how eating habits and overall health changes, it is sometimes too late to change pre-existing habits. The areas with relatively few grocery stores will also likely be areas that tend to be under-resourced and disadvantaged in other ways. Additionally, grocery stores are less likely to build in lower income neighborhoods and often veer away from areas where other businesses have not built due to concern of success.<br/>
            <br/>
            Food desert data is only being released every 5 years (so far 2010 and 2015), but preventative action could be taken to reverse at-risk regions if we could catch these census tracts early on. looking at the map of current food deserts below, we can see how many tracts are suffering from food deserts and how many areas could benefit from reversing these deserts.
